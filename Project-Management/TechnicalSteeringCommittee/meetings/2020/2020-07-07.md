* Core Infrastructure Best Practices

    * [Site](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)
    * [Criteria](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md)
    * A list of things as important software we should do
    * Other large OSI projects (GPG/Linux/K8s) have adopted this
    * Get a badge / certificate to say we have done this we can display
    * Health indication for how project is running, and points on where can we improve
    * *(Deferred)* Pending decision at next TSC meeting, as the group didn't feel there was enough members to form a consensus

* Code owners

    * [Github Blog Post](https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/)
    * Uses a file at the root of the repo to glob files / folders and associate them to code owners
    * Can specify groups instead of a user for a folder / file
    * Avoids a single person being the "go to person" for code questions
    * Could be useful for facility specific code, e.g. to prevent other developers breaking code by accident
    * It was pointed out that we should probably have facility specific code in their own repos anyway, but this isn't the current status quo
    * Concerns about churn with staff members, e.g. Sandwich students at ISIS were raised, and how to keep track of the current owner
    * *(Action)* Limited trial to start with:
        - Facility specific code 
        - Mantid Workbench (We need to figure out who should own what)
        - CMake Configuration (should be owned by TSC?)

* WSL

    * WSL2 now supports GUIs and should work correctly (although not tested with Mantid)
    * Concerns raised about the fact WSL would need to be installed, though we might not need admin for WSL2
    * If we can install support out of the box, we would consider this, but it appears barrier is too high for non-technical users?
    * Look at how other projects for how well this works, then come back to it later
    * However, it does highlight a problem where we have multiple ways to package for platforms so this could break on Windows/OSX which we should tackle before it becomes a problem
        - Such as OSX locking down more permissions, OpenGL for example
        - Windows not handling spaces in Paths
        - ...etc.
