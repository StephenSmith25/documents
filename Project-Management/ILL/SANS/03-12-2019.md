SANS (D33) Meeting
==================

Participants
------------

- Nina [N]
- Sylvain [S]
- Miguel [M]
- Gagik [G] 

Agenda 
------

- Separation of the results per panel for D33
- Resolutions
- Unisotropic
- TOF
- Generation of the tables/Tagging
- AOB

Minutes
-------

It was agreedas follows ordered by priority:
1. Need to concentrate on getting a valid I(Q) for monochromatic isotropic case.
2. Should discuss what else is needed for the unisotropic (magnetism)
3. Understand what's the correct way of calculation for TOF mode; for the moment it is a 2-step averaging without any weighting which seems reasonable
4. Revisit the resolution calculations for all these modes.

Actions
-------

Before the closure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

- [G] to amend the absolute scale normalization logic as encountered when testing on D11.
- [G] to implement I(Q) calculation separately for each panels for D33
- [G] to write a user script for D33 using auto process for the dataset of pluronics by Isabelle (contrasting TOF/mono)
- [N, S] to test that script and make sure that the output is reasonable and that the geometry is defined correctly
- [M, G] to check with Franck if he had done any updates on the nexus format recently

During the next cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- [N, S] to measure the dark currents check if they load in Mantid and feed back if they do not
- [N, S] to measure a standard calibration sample for absolute scale if there is a possibility
- [N, S] to try out the tagging for at least one proposal, then we see how we can properly exploit this information

Medium to long term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Think further about the resolution calculation
- Automatic table generation
- Automatic reduction
- GUI and special plotting
- Event mode data
